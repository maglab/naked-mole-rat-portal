                p.lead The naked mole-rat (<i>Heterocephalus glaber</i>) is a fascinating subterranean rodent that offers great promise as a biomedical model of resistance to disease, and diseases of ageing in particular. It is the longest-lived rodent and is exceptionally resistant to neoplasia, making it a unique model for research on ageing and cancer as well as other traits such as metabolic regulation, development, pain and behaviour.

                p This site aims to help researchers study the genome and genes of the naked mole-rat to better understand its extraordinary traits and foster further studies employing this unique organism. We develop genomic resources that facilitate studies on the naked mole-rat at various levels (e.g., cellular, molecular, genetic and biochemical). Specifically, we have sequenced the naked mole-rat genome using the Illumina/Solexa platform and developed a pipeline for gene expression profiling. The genome data is currently available on this site through both a BLAST server and direct download of FASTA files.
                p We are continually improving and analysing the naked mole-rat genome and welcome opportunities to collaborate with other researchers. Since our aim is to encourage studies in this emerging biomedical model, we are happy to work with the research community and the public to increase awareness and information of the naked mole-rat as a model of healthy ageing and cancer resistance. Please contact us if you have any questions or comments.
